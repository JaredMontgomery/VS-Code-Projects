A game that simulates Hangman.

1. Features:

- Underscores where chars of a word will go.

- Each word is randomly taken from a huge file of English words.

- A drawing of a hanged man, which builds up for each wrong guess. First wrong
guess gives the head, second gives right arm, third give left arm, fourth gives
torso, fifth gives right leg, and sixth gives left leg. The drawing will go
below the aforementioned underscores. So, the player is given 6 chances.

- Below the drawing will be a collection of letters that are wrong. It is added
onto for each wrong guess given.

- The game ends in a loss when the drawing is complete. The game ends in a win
if every char is guessed right.

- Multiple letters can be entered at once. Letters that are right are added to
the underscored word and letters that are wrong will add on to the drawing.

2. Algorithm:

- Select word randomly from a huge JS object.

- Repeat this until a win or a loss:
    - Print separated underscores for each char of the word.

    - Print the drawing so far.

    - Print the collection of wrong letters.

    - Ask for char input(s). Case doesn't matter.:

    - Go through each letter in the input:
        - If letter is in the word, then replace the right underscore with that
        letter.
        Otherwise, then update the drawing to the next one and add the letter onto
        the end of the wrong letters if it isn't there already.

    - If the drawing is complete, then the game ends in a loss.

    - If all underscores are replaced, then the game ends in a win.
