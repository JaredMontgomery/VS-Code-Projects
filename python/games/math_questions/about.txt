This is a program that keeps on asking math-related questions. You have a
certain number of attempts when answering. Hit this number and you'll lose.
Each question and its answers are randomly generated.

Features:

- Random questions and answers.
- Difficulties.
- Lives system.
- Scoring. You score more if you get questions right consecutively and less if
you get questions wrong consecutively.

Algorithm:

- Pick a [difficulty]. 1 for easy, 2 for normal, 3 for hard, and 4 for extreme.
Extreme, because I've always had a fondness for stupidly hard difficulties in
games.

- Set [lives] to [2 ** (4 - [difficulty])]. You get more lives on lower
difficulties. Makes sense, yes? Yes.

- Set [score] to 0. [right_amount] will hold the amount of questions answered
correctly. [wrong_amount] will hold the amount of questions answered wrong.

- Do repeatedly until [lives] have run out:
    - Generate a random question with 4 random answers. Each question consists
    of 2 numbers and an operation. The length of a number is based on
    difficulty. One of the answers is correct.

    - Take input from the user for the answer.

    - If the input is the right answer, add 100 * [difficulty] to the score.
    Otherwise, subtract 100 * [difficulty] from the score. The player gets
    rewarded more for completing more difficult tasks.

- Print "You lost." with the score, difficulty, the amount of right questions,
wrong questions, and the amount of questions in general.
